Deploy: https://nathannewman.github.io/todo-list/

This is my first JavaScript project. It's a very simple todo list. Users input a task into the input field and then click Add Task. The task in then added to an unordered list below. Each task also has a delete button so tasks can be removed. The todo list is saved to local storage, so that it loads when the user revisits the page.

Additional functionality was add for an autocomplete. The autocomplete terms are limited to: "Dinner", "Laundry", "Lunch", "Mow", "Homework", "Study", "Breakfast", and "Clean".
